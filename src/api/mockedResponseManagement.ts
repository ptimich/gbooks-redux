        description:
          "Over a century has passed and yet there is growing evidence that knowledge workers across the globe today are as constrained by F.W. Taylor's much-maligned The Principles of Scientific Management, as factory workers were in the early twentieth century. Re-Tayloring Management looks critically at Taylor's philosophy on management and contrasts it with other perspectives that have since emerged, along with the professionalization of management and the growth in business and management education. The contributors demonstrate that despite the complexity and uncertainty that organizations face, instead of designing work systems where knowledge and service workers have the freedom to apply knowledge and skills at the point they are most needed, managers are obsessed with maintaining tighter control. This approach conflicts with contemporary job design principles, which emphasise ‘job crafting’, whereby individuals are encouraged to craft their role in a way that is congruent with their identity. Drawing on insights from academics with diverse backgrounds and interests, and organised around 'past', 'present' and 'future' themes, this book is a thought-provoking read for professional managers, as well as for postgraduate students and academics teaching and researching organizational studies and management.",

          "In discussing a management topic, scholars, educators, practitioners, and the media often toss out the name of a theorist (Taylor, Simon, Weber) or make a sideways reference to a particular theory (bureaucracy, total quality management, groupthink) and move on, as if assuming their audience possesses the necessary background to appreciate and integrate the reference. This is often far from the case. Individuals are frequently forced to seek out a hodgepodge of sources varying in quality and presentation to provide an overview of a particular idea. This work is designed to serve as a core reference for anyone interested in the essentials of contemporary management theory. Drawing together a team of international scholars, it examines the global landscape of the key theories and the theorists behind them, presenting them in the context needed to understand their strengths and weaknesses to thoughtfully apply them. In addition to interpretations of long-established theories, it also offers essays on cutting-edge research as one might find in a handbook. And, like an unabridged dictionary, it provides concise, to-the-point definitions of key concepts, ideas, schools, and figures. Features and Benefits: Two volumes containing over 280 signed entries provide users with the most authoritative and thorough reference resources available on management theory, both in terms of breadth and depth of coverage. Standardized presentation format, organized into categories based on validity and importance, structures entries so that readers can assess the fundamentals, evolution, and impact of theories. To ease navigation between and among related entries, a Reader’s Guide groups entries thematically and each entry is followed by Cross-References. In the electronic version, the Reader’s Guide combines with the Cross-References and a detailed Index to provide robust search-and-browse capabilities. An appendix with a Chronology of Management Theory allows readers to easily chart directions and trends in thought and theory from early times to the present. An appendix with Central Management Insights allows readers to easily understand, compare, and apply major theoretical messages of the field. Suggestions for Further Reading at the end of each entry guide readers to sources for more detailed research and discussion. Key themes include: Nature of Management Managing People, Personality, and Perception Managing Motivation Managing Interactions Managing Groups Managing Organizations Managing Environments Strategic Management Human Resources Management International Management and Diversity Managerial Decision Making, Ethics, and Creativity Management Education, Research, and Consulting Management of Operations, Quality, and Information Systems Management of Entrepreneurship Management of Learning and Change Management of Technology and Innovation Management and Leadership Management and Social / Environmental Issues PLUS: Appendix of Chronology of Management Theory PLUS: Appendix of Central Management Insights",

          "(Originally Published in 1963 by R.D. Irwin) The Management Process presents new and traditional subject matter in a diff erent context because it is felt that greater emphasis should be given to the interaction of the management functions. All managers plan, organize, and control the work of others, but not in a simple, sequential pattern. Managing is a continuous operation or process involving the interaction of these functions. Managers must plan for organizing activity, organize for it, and control it, and they must perform these same functions for control. It is felt that practicing managers do, in eff ect, think in these terms. Consequently, an analysis of traditional and other materials in this context should not only be more realistic but also more meaningful to the student or practitioner. Reference to the chapter headings in the Table of Contents will illustrate the way in which this interaction approach provides a basic framework for the organization of this book. As a text this book is intended for a fi rst course in management, or a more advanced course, depending upon the characteristics of the curriculum in which it is used. No specifi c course preparation, however, need be regarded as prerequisite to its use.",

        title: "Managing Consultants",
        subtitle: "Consultancy as the Management of Impressions",
        authors: ["Clark, Timothy"],
        publisher: "McGraw-Hill Education (UK)",
        publishedDate: "1995-11-01",
        description:
          "Managers are increasingly being convinced from all sides that traditional structures, systems and cultures are no longer appropriate to today's competitive conditions; and that organizations must change fundamentally. It is in the context of these pressures that managers feel it increasingly necessary to seek external support by turning to those who offer some solution to these dilemmas - the management consultants. This book argues that the initial selection of a management consultancy and the subsequent evaluation of the quality of service they deliver are inherently problematic. Two root causes are identified: the structure and dynamics of the management consultancy industry; and the characteristics of the management consultancy service. Timothy Clark examines how these problems are overcome by revealing the foundations of a successful and long-term client-consultant relationship. In a departure from previous analyses of management consultancy he argues that the key to understanding consultancy and its success is to appreciate that successful consultancy, in it methods at least, emphasizes the active management of the client-consultant relationship. At the core of successful consultancy is the art of impression management. A consultant seeks to create a reality which persuades the client that they have purchased a high-quality service. The work of consultants is analysed and understood in terms of the theatrical analogy or dramaturgical metaphor. A consultancy intervention is therefore conceived of as a dramatic event. This is illustrated with reference to two types of consultancy work - executive search (i.e. headhunting) and the work of management gurus.",

          "Criza economică din ultimii ani a scos în evidență o serie de probleme ale managementului strategic aplicat în interiorul organizațiilor. În Anti-Strategic Management, autorul pune sub semnul întrebării concepte și teorii ale managementului strategic și propune o perspectivă diferită, motivată de intenția de a demitiza abordările-șablon din domeniu. Demersul său este susținut cu studii de caz centrate pe situația din România, iar punctele care au iscat controverse academice sunt tratate într-o manieră critică pe baza unei vaste experiențe la catedră și în conducerea unor societăți economice. Lucrarea se adresează profesioniștilor din domeniu, studenților la facultățile de științe economice și celor interesați de aspectele teoretice mai puțin tributare manualelor sau schemelor instrumentale consacrate.",

          "În acest volum devenit clasic, Tony Bush schițează cadrul conceptual de orientare a activității decidenților din educație și analizează șase modele de management pe care le pune în relație cu zece modele de leadership. Noțiunile teoretice sunt ilustrate cu numeroase studii de caz din toate mediile educaționale, de la școala primară la universitate, într-o varietate de contexte internaționale. Printre tematicile specifice abordate se numără centralizarea și descentralizarea în educație, școlile în sistem de management autonom, relația dintre teorie și practică sau natura și caracteristicile managementului educațional. Conceptele-cheie, rezumatele și subiectele de dezbatere incluse în fiecare capitol facilitează utilizarea lucrării și că suport de curs. Leadership și management educațional este un excelent instrument de lucru pentru cei care dețin funcții decizionale în cadrul unităților de învățământ și în sistemul educațional în general.",
